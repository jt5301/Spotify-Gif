# Spotify Profile Viewer

Deployed Link Here: https://spotifyviewprof.herokuapp.com/

A work in progress web application built with Node, Express.js, React-Redux to interact with Spotifyâ€™s Web API to view personalized listening data, recommend and add new music on Spotify based on user playlists (and eventually with gifs!) 

Also as a heads up: The feature to add a created playlist will create/add the playlist of recommended songs to your account.
